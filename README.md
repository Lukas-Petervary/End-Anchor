# End-Anchor
Single block mod inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1i4izl25V4">Kenadian</a>

<p>I'm lazy and bad at art so I just used the respawn anchor textures, but if you have a better alternative please please PLEASE hit me up and I can release it with **<em>aesthetics**</em></p>

<p>All the source code is provided, and I encourage you to take a look (always good to be safe). I haven't thoroughly bug-tested it, so reach out with any dire, game-breaking crashes</p>
